## web camera using Java


I have tried number of ways to do this, from a long time.

JMF - Now it is dead
FMJ - Now it is dead too
VLCJ - too much because I am not creating a music/video player and it expect VLC to be installed
Xuggler - too much and hard work
JMyron - didn't work
JavaFX - I thought it could do it, but seems like it can't
