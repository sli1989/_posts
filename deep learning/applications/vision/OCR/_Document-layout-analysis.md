Before the “character” recognition will take place, the logical structure of the document has to be be analyzed and defined. For example:

- Where are text blocks, paragraphs, lines?
- Is there a table that should be reconstructed?
- Are there any “images” on the page(s)?
- Are there any barcodes to read?
